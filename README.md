# Arduino-Nano-Granular
This pcb design project is based on Peter Knight's Arduino Nano Synth code and Notes and Volts Line Output upgrade. You can find all components needed in Schematic and .xls file. It has 2 option to power the device. It can be  power up by directly arduino usb socket or power adaptor socket by using a 9v adaptor. Please pay attention if your adaptors pinout should be right this; TIP : (-), SLEVE: (+). And do not plug the adaptor and usb power at the say time. That might burn some components on arduino nano.  The pcb designed as copper areas for GND and +5V. I designed this pcb on  https://easyeda.com. Thanks to https:/jlcpcb.com to create https://easyeda.com/ where you can design pcbs online or its desktop app.  Thanks to Notes&amp;Volts for easy tutorial videos about this project. You can download the code by clicking the link below and reading the article.  https://www.notesandvolts.com/2014/07/build-auduino-granular-synth-part-1.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTob27lOpcU
